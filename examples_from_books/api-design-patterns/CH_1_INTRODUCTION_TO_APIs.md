### Summary Of Chapter 1: Introduction to APIs

* Interfaces are contracts that define how two systems should interact with one another.
* APIs are special types of interfaces that define how two computer systems interact with one another,
  coming in many forms, suck as downloadable libraries and web APIs.
* Web APIs are special because they expose functionality over a network, hiding the specific implementation or
  computational requirements needed for that functionality.
* Resource-oriented APIs are a way of designing APIs to reduce complexity by relying on a standard set of actions,
  called _methods_ across a limited set of things, called _resources_.
* What makes APIs "good" is a bit ambiguous, but generally good APIs are operational, expressive, simple and
  predictable.
