# Socket Events in Node.js

In Node.js, a socket object is created when a client or server creates a network connection using TCP or IPC. The socket object is an instance of the `net.Socket` or `dgram.Socket` class, depending on the type of connection, and provides an interface for sending and receiving data over the network connection.

There are several events that can be emitted by a socket object in Node.js, including:

- `close`: emitted when the socket is fully closed
- `connect`: emitted when a connection is successfully established
- `data`: emitted when data is received
- `drain`: emitted when the write buffer becomes empty
- `end`: emitted when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet
- `error`: emitted when an error occurs
- `lookup`: emitted when the hostname is resolved
- `timeout`: emitted when a socket has timed out due to inactivity

When a `connect` event is emitted by a socket object, it means that a connection has been established. The `data` event is emitted when data is received, and the event handler is passed a Buffer object containing the received data. The `end` event is emitted when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet, indicating that the socket is being closed.
