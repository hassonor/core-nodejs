#### Number
The JavaScript Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value,
like a double in Java or C#. This means it can represent fractional values, but there are some limits to the stored
number's magnitude and precision.

#### BigInt
BigInt values represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive...
It is created by appending n to the end of an integer literal, or byu calling the BigInt() function
(without the new operator) and giving it an integer value of string value.
