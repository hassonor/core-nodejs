# Modules and Concurrency

_____________________________________________________________

### What exactly is a Module?

\
**Module(In Node.js)**\
A file (or a folder) that contains code

### The Event Loop

What Node uses to process asynchronous actions and interface them for you so that you don't have to deal with threads.

run: `ps -ef | grep node` to filter the list to any processes that are matching the word node.

### Errors vs Exceptions

**Error is "Problem"** | **Exception is "Condition"**
