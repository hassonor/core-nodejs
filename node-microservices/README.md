#### Basic Principles of Microservices

- A microservice should focus on a single responsibility, such as retrieving customer data from a backend system.
- Microservices should be designed and deployed independently of other parts of the application.
- Communication between microservices should leverage standard HTTP methods.

**Example**: A microservice for user authentication, separate from another microservice handling product management.

#### Benefits of Using Microservices

- New developers can focus on specific services without needing to understand the entire application.
- Services can be developed and deployed by independent teams.
- Services can be built using the most suitable programming language for the task at hand.
- Failure in one service does not necessarily cause the entire application to fail.

**Example**: A team of Python developers working on a recommendation service, while another team of Node.js developers works on the user authentication service.

#### Drawbacks of Using Microservices

- Potential for code redundancies.
- Challenges in rolling out new versions of services.
- Increased difficulty in testing.
- Complexity shifts to the network layer.

**Example**: Overlapping functionality between a product management service and an order management service, both implementing similar code for managing inventory.
